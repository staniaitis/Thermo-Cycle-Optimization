# Objective

# Approach

# Algorithm Design and Implementation
Developed a MATLAB algorithm to compute state values based on any two given parameters. The algorithm ensures accurate and efficient calculation of the state parameters critical to the Carnot cycle.

# System Modeling and Simulation
Utilized Simulink to model the system and perform dynamic simulations. This approach facilitated the precise plotting of the Carnot cycle, allowing for a clear and detailed visualization of the process.

# Outcome
Provided a comprehensive illustration of the pressure-volume (P-V) relationship throughout each stage of the Carnot cycle. The visual representation effectively demonstrates the thermodynamic processes and transitions, enhancing the understanding of the Carnot cycle.
